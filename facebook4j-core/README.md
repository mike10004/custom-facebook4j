Custom facebook4j-core Fork
===========================

This fork includes a modification to the upstream sources such that model 
objects, such a User or Post, retain the original source JSON object with 
which they were created.

An alternate POM, pom-mike10004.xml, allows me to deploy to Maven central 
under a different groupId and version.
